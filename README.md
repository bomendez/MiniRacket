# MiniRacket

## A loosely turing-complete language in GoLang

### A console-based minature version of Racket, a modern dialect of Lisp. Using prefix notation, this program tokenizes input using RegEx and parses expressions into an abstract syntax tree, which can be also easily evaluated/executed with high performance. The following are supported in this version:
<ul>
  <li>Numeric values</li>
  <li>Boolean values</li>
  <li>Unary operators (+ - * /) </li>
  <li>Comparison operators</li>
  <li>If-then-else</li>
  <li>Variable definition</li>
  <li>Function definition and calls</li>
</ul>
